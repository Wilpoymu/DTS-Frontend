# Carrier Waterfalls Refactoring

## Overview

This directory contains the refactored Carrier Waterfalls component, breaking down a large monolithic component into smaller, more manageable pieces with better separation of concerns.

## Structure

```
carrier-waterfalls/
├── index.tsx                          # Main router component
├── shared/
│   ├── types.ts                      # Shared TypeScript interfaces
│   └── hooks/
│       ├── useWaterfall.ts           # Main business logic hook
│       ├── useLocalStorage.ts        # LocalStorage utilities
│       └── useGenericLocalStorage.ts # Generic localStorage hook
├── lane-creation/
│   └── LaneCreationView.tsx          # Lane creation and waterfall listing view
├── waterfall-config/
│   └── WaterfallConfigView.tsx       # Complete waterfall configuration interface
└── waterfall-details/
    └── WaterfallDetailsView.tsx      # Waterfall execution monitoring and details
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Views**: Each step (`lane-creation`, `waterfall-config`, `waterfall-details`) has its own component
- **Business Logic**: Centralized in custom hooks
- **Utilities**: Shared utilities like localStorage operations are in dedicated hooks
- **Types**: All TypeScript interfaces are centralized

### 2. **Custom Hooks**
- `useWaterfall`: Main business logic and state management
- `useLocalStorage`: LocalStorage operations and persistence

### 3. **Component Structure**
- **Main Router** (`index.tsx`): Handles navigation between views
- **View Components**: Each view is self-contained with its own props interface
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI components are imported from the UI library

## Migration Status

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Shared types definition
- [x] LocalStorage utilities hook
- [x] Main waterfall business logic hook
- [x] Lane creation view
- [x] Waterfall configuration view and components
- [x] Main router component
- [x] Waterfall details view and execution monitor
- [x] Legacy wrapper for backward compatibility

### 🚧 In Progress
- [x] Carrier search and management components
- [x] Tier management components
- [x] Draft auto-save functionality
- [x] Complete CRUD operations

### 📝 Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Execution Controls**
   - Implement real waterfall pause/resume functionality
   - Add waterfall status management
   - Real-time execution monitoring

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Carrier performance metrics
   - Response time analytics  
   - Success rate tracking

3. **Integration Features**
   - Real carrier data integration
   - Email/SMS communication system
   - Load management system integration

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Component lazy loading
   - State optimization
   - Real-time updates with WebSocket

## Usage

The refactored component maintains the same public API as the original:

```tsx
import CarrierWaterfalls from './components/carrier-waterfalls'

// Basic usage
<CarrierWaterfalls />

// With navigation from loads
<CarrierWaterfalls 
  initialWaterfallId="wf-123"
  loadInfo={{
    loadId: "LD-456",
    laneId: "lane-789",
    assignedTier: "Tier 1"
  }}
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand and modify
2. **Reusability**: Shared hooks and utilities can be used across different parts of the application
3. **Testing**: Individual components and hooks can be unit tested in isolation
4. **Performance**: Code splitting opportunities with smaller components
5. **Developer Experience**: Better IntelliSense and type checking with focused interfaces

## Files Overview

### `shared/types.ts`
Contains all TypeScript interfaces used across the waterfall components.

### `shared/hooks/useWaterfall.ts`
Main business logic hook that manages:
- Navigation state
- Waterfall data (lanes, carriers, tiers)
- LocalStorage persistence
- Event handlers

### `shared/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`
Utility hook for localStorage operations:
- Save/load current waterfall
- Save/load completed waterfalls
- Clear operations

### `lane-creation/LaneCreationView.tsx`
Handles:
- New lane creation form
- Existing waterfalls table
- Status filtering and pagination

### `index.tsx`
Main router that:
- Uses the business logic hook
- Renders appropriate view based on current step
- Handles navigation between views
